## Streets

- Rain
- Street food
- Train w/ sparks

Is in the street, it's night, it's raining a lot. A few people running about, getting away from the rain. Some others are getting some shelter/food/light from a street stall(s).

---

Exits into street from cafe. Lights up cigarette. Needs to get across town to meet publisher to show manuscript.

### Obstacles

Confrontational person at stall? Someone needing help at stall? How can this be related to the universe?

In a dark alley, sees someone scratching in a bin in an animal-like way. As he gets closer it hisses and disappears. Carries on to station, and sees trains coming and going, generating a lot of sparks. After watching for a while, the sparks seem to take a life of their own and start heading somewhere. Tries to follow them, but after a while can't go any farther. The animal-like person appears, and offers a way to see the sparks, if player does/finds something first... (leads back to encounter at street stall)

## Script

Sitting in a small cafe, at a table with an elder colleague. Swing music playing, people smoking, some background chatter. Obviously set in the early 20th century, possibly clear that is Japan.

**[5: Ego]**

NARRATOR:           He and an elder colleague sat at a cafe table puffing on
                    cigarattes. He said very little, but he paid close
                    attention to his companion's every word.

ELDER COLLEAGUE:    I spent half the day riding around in an automobile.

AKUTAGAWA:          Was there something you needed to do?

ELDER COLLEAGUE:    ...*sigh*...No, I just felt like riding around

NARRATOR:           The words released him into a world of which he
                    knew nothing - a world of 'ego' close to the gods.
                    He felt a kind of pain but, at the same time,
                    a kind of joy.

NARRATOR:           The cafe was extremely small. Beneath a framed
                    picture of the god Pan, however, a rubber tree
                    in a red pot thrust its thick leaves out and down.

---

ELDER COLLEAGUE:    The manuscript is fine. Take it.

Akutagawa gets up to leave. Heads to the door, puts on his jacket and hat, then leaves.

**[8: Sparks: flowers of fire]**

On the street he lights a cigarette. Akutagawa walks through the rain for a while. There are a few people running about trying to get out of the rain, a few others are sheltering under awnings.

NARRATOR:           Soaked by the rain, he trod along the asphalt. It
                    was a heavy downpour. In the enveloping spray, he caught
                    the smell of his rubberized coat.

*[PUZZLE 1]* - some people at a food stall. There are a few people there who will talk to you. One is confrontational and another who needs some sort of help... It isn't necessarily possible to complete either of them at the moment, but will be part of a larger puzzle??

Akutagawa carries on, and ends up in dark covered alley (**why?**). It is a bit leaky and dingy. There is some noise up ahead. As Akutagawa gets closer, he can see someone ratching in some bins/debris in a kind of feral manner. As Akutagawa eventually gets closer, the person (who is kind of subtly glowing in a monsterous fashion) sits bolt-upright, turns around and hisses before disappearing. The way is now clear for Akutagawa to continue. He gets to the train station access but it is locked.

*[PUZZLE 2]* - get access to exit onto the street again!

He walks through to the street again. There are some trains. One goes past.

NARRATOR:           Just then he saw the overhead trolley line giving off purple
                    sparks and was strangely moved. His jacket pocket contained
                    the manuscript of the piece he was planning to publish in
                    their little magazine.

NARRATOR:           Walking through the rain, he looked back and up
                    once again at the trolley line.

Another train comes past, and sends of *a lot* of sparks, which bounce past him and glow more than previous sparks.

NARRATOR:           The cable was still sending sharp sparks into the air.
                    He could think of nothing in life that he especially
                    desired, but those purple sparks - those wildly-blooming
                    flowers of fire - he would trade his life for the
                    chance to hold them in his hands.

The sparks start to slow down, and then appear to hover in mid-air. They than start to move slowly, but purposefully, somewhere - as if on a steady current. Akutagawa can see where they are going. Moving along he finds a ladder that seems to go in the direction he wants. Suddenly, the ratching person appears next to him.

*[PUZZLE 3]* - Help the thing, to get access to where the sparks are going

After getting access, Akutagawa sees where they the sparks are going. It is a big glowing tree!

**[18: Moon]**

He happened to pass her on the stairway of a certain hotel. Her face seemed to be bathed in moonlight even now, in daylight. As he watched her walk on (they had never met), he felt a loneliness he had not known before.
